# Dockerized-Web-Application

This is a sample React application intended for testing as a Dockerized application with Jenkins deployment. This repository focuses on demonstrating the process of containerizing a React application using Docker and integrating it with Jenkins for automated deployment. The project showcases the entire pipeline, from Dockerization to deployment on a Kubernetes cluster.

# A comprehensive overview of the React app, including its features, usage instructions.

Component Initialization:
The App component is defined as a JavaScript function.
It returns JSX representing the structure of the component.

Rendering:
When the App component is rendered, it displays a header with an image (logo), a paragraph containing a greeting message with the user's name, and a link to the project's GitHub repository.

Dynamic Content:
The user's name is retrieved from the user object, allowing for dynamic content in the greeting message.

Styling:
Styling rules defined in the App.css file are applied to the rendered elements, ensuring consistent appearance.

Export:
The App component is exported to make it available for use in other parts of the application.

Overall, this code represents a simple React component that renders a basic UI with dynamic content and integrates with external resources (logo image and GitHub repository link).
